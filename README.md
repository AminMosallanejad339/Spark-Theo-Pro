# 🚀 Spark-Theo: Apache Spark Learning Roadmap (Data Engineering Focus)

Welcome to **Spark-Theo** — a structured roadmap and hands-on portfolio for mastering **Apache Spark** with a focus on **Data Engineering**.  
This repository contains **theory notes**, **practice notebooks**, and **end-to-end projects**, organized in a way to help you build Spark expertise step by step.

## 🔥 What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is an **open-source distributed computing engine** designed for **big data processing** and **analytics**.  
It provides a unified platform for **batch processing, real-time streaming, machine learning, and graph analytics** — all at scale.  

Key features:
- In-memory distributed computing (much faster than Hadoop MapReduce)
- APIs in Python (PySpark), Scala, Java, R
- Modules: **Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib, GraphX**
- Handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

---

## ❓ Why Spark?

- **Speed**: 100x faster than MapReduce for many workloads  
- **Scalability**: Runs on a single laptop or across thousands of cluster nodes  
- **Flexibility**: Supports batch ETL, streaming, ML, and graph processing  
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Works with Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, Cassandra, S3, Delta Lake, Kubernetes, etc.  
- **Industry Standard**: Widely used in Data Engineering, Data Science, and AI pipelines  

---

## 🕰 Short History of Spark

- **2009** → Spark was created at **UC Berkeley’s AMPLab** as a faster alternative to Hadoop MapReduce.  
- **2010** → Spark was open-sourced under a BSD license.  
- **2013** → Became an **Apache Software Foundation project**.  
- **2014+** → Exploded in popularity with Spark SQL, Streaming, MLlib, GraphX.  
- **Today** → Spark is the **#1 distributed data processing engine**, powering data pipelines at Netflix, Uber, Amazon, Alibaba, and many others.
